[00:06.99] I said the night you left me,
[00:11.02] Nothin' worse could ever happen,
[00:14.74] But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong.
[00:23.18] And when your eyes met mine,
[00:26.55] I knew that you were gone forever,
[00:31.03] Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on.
[00:39.63] I'd be better off in a pine box,
[00:45.28] On a slow train back to Georgia,
[00:48.95] Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
[00:56.15] I think I'd rather die,
[00:58.27] And go to hell and face the devil,
[01:04.12] Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
[01:31.12] 
[01:17.82] I always thought that someday,
[01:21.31] We might get back together.
[01:25.24] I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly.
[01:33.06] But when I saw the lovin' way,
[01:37.32] You held onto each other,
[01:41.62] It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry.
[02:11.62] 
[01:50.93] I'd be better off in a pine box,
[01:55.31] On a slow train back to Georgia,
[01:58.97] Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
[02:05.82] I think I'd rather die,
[02:08.23] And go to hell and face the devil,
[02:14.53] Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
[02:41.53] 
[02:22.88] Girl I'd be better off in a pine box,
[02:27.35] On a slow train back from Georgia,
[02:31.20] Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
[02:38.24] I think I'd rather die,
[02:40.89] And go to hell and face the devil,
[02:47.37] Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
[03:14.37] 
[02:56.48] I can't lie here with you and him together on my mind
