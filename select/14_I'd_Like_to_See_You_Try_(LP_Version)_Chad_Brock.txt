You've been hintin' at commitment
In spite of what I told you from the start
If you think I'm gonna buy all that forever talkin'
You won't get too far
Don't you know I'm just too set in my ways
And I'm afraid it's just too late for me to change

'Cause I've been rolling like a river
Always flowing to wherever all my life
Even so you think you know what you can do
To make me never say goodbye
Yeah right
Baby, that ain't gonna happen
But I'd like to see you try

If you really wanna tie me down
Then throw those loving arms around me now
I won't stop you if you must insist on kissing me
Until I come around
Yeah, that would do the trick if I was so inclined
But I'm warning you, you're wasting your time

'Cause I've been rolling like a river
Always flowing to wherever all my life
Even so you think you know what you can do
To make me never say goodbye
Yeah right
Baby, that ain't gonna happen
But I'd like to see you try

Don't you know I'm just too set in my ways
I'm afraid it's just too late for me to change

'Cause I've been rolling like a river
Always flowing to wherever all my life
Even so you think you know what you can do
To make me never say goodbye
Yeah right
Baby, that ain't gonna happen
But I'd like to see you try

Baby, that ain't gonna happen
But I'd like to see you try
I'd like to see you try
